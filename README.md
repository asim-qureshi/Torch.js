# Zipper.js
A simple jQuery plugin that triggers functions when DOM elements reach specfied points in the window/document. 

This plugin aims to work like the scroll animations found at Zed Shaw's 'Learn Python the hard way" (http://learnpythonthehardway.org/), in that it allows you to execute a function when a certain element is at a specified position within the window, and also allows you to execute a function on a reverse (upward) scroll at the same or a different point.
